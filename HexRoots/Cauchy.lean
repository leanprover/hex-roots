/-!
The starting point of the subdivision: a single square, centred at the
origin, whose circumscribed region covers the Cauchy root bound of the
input polynomial. Every complex root of `p` lies strictly inside this
square, so refinement can begin from it.

The half-width is `2^{-prec}` with `prec := -(cauchyExp p)`, negative
whenever the root bound exceeds `1`; `cauchyExp` is pure integer
arithmetic on the coefficient magnitudes, with no floating point.

/-- Smallest `e : Nat` with `2^e ≥ 1 + max_{i<n} |aᵢ| / |aₙ|` (the Cauchy
    root bound): every complex root of `p` satisfies `|z| < 2^e`, so all
    roots lie in the square of half-width `2^e` about `0`. Pure integer
    arithmetic: with `L := |aₙ|` the leading magnitude and
    `M := max_{i<n} |aᵢ|` the largest non-leading magnitude, take
    `e := ceilLog2 ⌈(L + M) / L⌉ = ceilLog2 ((L + M + L - 1) / L)`. Junk
    `0` when `p` is the zero polynomial (no leading coefficient). -/

/-- The starting component: a single square centred at `0` covering the
    Cauchy root bound, with `candidateK = deg p`. Its half-width is
    `2^{-prec}` with `prec = -(cauchyExp p)`, so its closed square
    contains every complex root of `p`. -/
