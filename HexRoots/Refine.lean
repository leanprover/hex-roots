/-!
The shared fuel-based driver loop of the complex root isolator, and the
thin `DyadicRootIsolation.refineTo?` wrapper over it.

`isolateLoop` refines a worklist of components round by round. A round emits
when all components certify at stored precision at least `target`, their
circumscribed discs are pairwise disjoint, and either every certificate is
already an atom or the worklist has reached the fixed `completenessDepth`.
Before that depth, a non-emitting round globally subdivides and reglues all
survivors; this eliminates rootless halo components and is the invariant used
by the completeness proof. Afterwards the hold/adopt optimization takes over
while the loop recurses on the smaller fuel. The fuel counts down
structurally on a `Nat`, so the recursion needs no termination proof;
`stopDepth p target` fixes the depth at which the drivers give up. Every
quantity here is exact: the emission test is a pairwise
`DyadicSquare.discsMeet` comparison of stored squares, and the precision
comparisons are on the exact `Int` precs.

The public one-atom wrapper first tries a bounded lineage-local speculative
pass, preserving Newton's logarithmic precision growth. If that pass cannot
emit exactly one target-ready atom, `refineLoop` restarts from the original
atom and uses the same globally reglued prefix as the full driver; subdivision
can split even a single starting square into sibling survivor lineages.

namespace Hex

/-- The fixed give-up margin above `separationDepth` used by `stopDepth`.
    Overshooting costs only a few extra subdivision rounds in the rare case
    certification had not already happened, and nothing else. The globally
    normalized prefix ends three levels before this bound. -/
@[expose] def stopSlack : Nat := 8

/-- The depth at which the drivers give up,
    `max target (separationDepth p) + stopSlack`. A `none` from a driver means
    that its full emission condition was not reached within this fuel bound. -/
@[expose] def stopDepth (p : ZPoly) (target : Int) : Int :=
  max target (separationDepth p : Int) + (stopSlack : Int)

/-- The depth through which the Cauchy-started driver uses globally glued,
uniform subdivision rounds. Two levels pay for `encSquare`; the other three
cover the quadrupled Pellet base (or doubled NK base) with one strict margin
level. -/
@[expose] def completenessDepth (p : ZPoly) (target : Int) : Int :=
  max target (separationDepth p : Int) + 5

namespace Component

/-- The common `prec` of a component's squares (`0` for the empty component,
    which the drivers never produce). -/
@[expose] def prec (c : Component) : Int :=
  (c.squares[0]?.map (·.prec)).getD 0

end Component

/-- The stored square of a certification result: the atom's square, or the

/-- Re-enter a certification result into the worklist as a component.

    The retained square must *cover* the certified region, not merely be
    certified: refinement preserves exactly the roots that lie in the
    retained squares themselves (children partition the square, and the
    `T₀` discard is sound), while a Pellet certificate counts roots in
    the stored square's circumscribed *disc*. A root in the disc but
    outside the square would be silently lost by the next subdivision;
    with repeated Newton-jump adoptions this loses far roots of a
    many-root cluster (the certified disc shrinks toward the cluster's
    Newton centroid while still counting every root). Retaining the
    *doubled* stored square (half-width `2·2^{−prec}` ≥ the disc radius
    `√2·2^{−prec}`) restores the cover for both certificate forms, at
    the cost of one precision level, which the strictly-finer adoption
    guard in `isolateLoop` still absorbs (a Newton jump gains at least
    two levels). -/

/-- The shared driver loop over the worklist. It may emit before
    `completenessDepth` when every result is already an atom and target-ready,
    with pairwise-disjoint discs. Before
    that depth, every non-emitting round globally refines and reglues the
    retained squares, irrespective of attempted certificates. At and beyond
    that depth, ready and disjoint cluster results may emit too. Otherwise: a
    component already certified at target whose disc
    is disjoint from every other certified disc holds its position; every
    other surviving component subdivides one level, except that one adopting
    a strictly finer certified result keeps that result as a one-square
    component instead. Each post-normalization non-emitting round strictly
    increases every non-held component's prec, and held components sit at
    target, so the laggard's prec reaches `stopDepth` within
    `(stopDepth − min prec)` rounds. A held component can be forced back
    into refinement late, when a slow sibling finally certifies with an
    overlapping disc, so `fuelFor` budgets a second climb on top: past
    `separationDepth` every certified disc is below `sep/4` and distinct
    roots' discs are disjoint, so `(stopDepth − target)` further rounds
    suffice. `fuel = 0` returns `none` (up to a
    harmless constant of overshoot). The recursion is structural on the
