Core conformance checks for `HexRoots`, the certified complex-root isolator.

Oracle: python-flint (`fmpz_poly.complex_roots()`; ci tier, wired by a sibling
work unit). Mode: `if_available`.

The checks below assert *independently derived* mathematical facts about the
roots of committed polynomials — the number of roots (fundamental theorem of
algebra), the exact rational roots, roots of unity on the unit circle,
Chebyshev roots on the real axis, the closed-form separation and Cauchy
precisions — never a value obtained by re-running the operation under test.
Disc containment and geometry are checked in exact `Rat` arithmetic via
`Dyadic.toRat` of the stored centres and radii.

Covered operations:
- `isolate` — all-atoms driver for squarefree inputs.
- `isolateAll?` — worklist driver returning atoms and clusters.
- `DyadicRootIsolation.refineTo?` — precision refinement of one atom.
- `RefinedIsolation.sameRoot` — root identity up to isolation.
- `witnessCheck` / `witness` — three-radius strong Pellet certificate.
- `nkWitnessCheck` / `nkWitness` — Newton-Kantorovich atom certificate.
- `rootFree` — single-radius `T₀` emptiness certificate.
- `taylor` — exact Gaussian-dyadic Taylor expansion.
- `mahlerPrec` — closed-form separation precision.
- `cauchyExp` — Cauchy root-bound exponent.
- `Component.refine1` — one subdivision + `T₀` discard + gluing round.
- `Component.certify?` — per-component certification.

Covered properties:
- a squarefree degree-`n` polynomial isolates to exactly `n` atoms;
- each known rational root lies in the circumscribed disc of exactly one atom
  (discs are pairwise disjoint at the emitted precision);
- every atom of a cyclotomic polynomial sits on the unit circle, and every
  atom of a Chebyshev polynomial sits on the real axis inside `[−1, 1]`;
- the three atom strategies `nk`, `pellet`, `nkThenPellet` agree on the atom
  count and produce pairwise-matching atoms (each atom of one strategy meets
  exactly one atom of another);
- a non-squarefree input keeps its multiple root as a `k = 2` cluster rather
  than atomizing it;
- `refineTo?` reaches the requested precision and preserves the root (the old
  and new discs still meet), can emit before the full global prefix when its
  singleton result is already ready, and succeeds for a simple selected root
  with a repeated root elsewhere in the polynomial;
- `sameRoot` is `true` within a root's isolation class and `false` across
  distinct roots;
- both witnesses fire at a simple root and fail off-root or at the wrong count;
- `rootFree` certifies discs far from every root;
- `taylor p 0` is the coefficient cast and a shifted expansion matches the
  hand-computed synthetic division;
- `mahlerPrec` and `cauchyExp` equal their closed forms.

Covered edge cases:
- the zero polynomial (`isolate` returns `none`);
- a nonzero constant (`isolate` returns `some #[]`);
- the linear polynomial `x` (one atom at the origin);
- the non-squarefree `(x²+1)(x−5)²` (a `k = 2` cluster survives);
- components far from every root (`refine1` empties them, `certify?` returns
  `none`, `rootFree` is `true`).

The degree-10 Chebyshev fixture `T₁₀` is exercised only on its cheap
operations because full `isolate` runs far past this module's
elaboration-time budget. The small Mignotte polynomial
`x⁵ − (100x − 1)²` now pins full five-root isolation under every strategy.

The runtime squarefreeness decision confirms `mignotte` has only simple
roots, and its coefficient array is re-derived by `taylor` at `0` above.
`isolate` must find all five roots: the close real pair straddling `1/100`
(separation about `2^{−16.4}`), the real root near `21.5377`, and the
complex pair near `−10.78 ± 18.66i`. It checks that worklist re-entry retains
only squares covering the certified disc and that all three large-magnitude
roots are preserved under every atom strategy. -/
