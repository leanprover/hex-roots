JSONL emit driver for the `hex-roots` oracle.

`lake exe hexroots_emit_fixtures` writes one `poly` fixture record per
input case followed by one `isolateAll32` `result` record carrying the
outcome of `Hex.isolateAll?` at target precision `32`. The companion
oracle `scripts/oracle/roots_flint.py` re-runs each polynomial through
python-flint's `fmpz_poly.complex_roots()` (certified Arb balls with
multiplicities) and cross-checks that the Lean certification discs
cover the flint roots with matching multiplicities.

The driver uses `isolateAll?` at target `32` rather than `isolate`: the oracle
needs root *locations*, not the separation precision `isolate` forces.

**Fixture set.** The CI tier contains 50 degree-20 dense
polynomials from the seed-`0xC0FFEE` LCG, plus the small curated rational and
Gaussian-rational cases that exercise simple atoms and real/complex
multiple-root clusters. The all-atoms local finisher makes fresh degree-20
emission practical (the soft front end is deliberately size-gated above this
tier); rounded Newton recentring keeps the exact rational centre representation compact.
Every run regenerates the full deterministic set before python-flint checks the
committed JSONL, so a kernel change cannot leave stale certificates unnoticed.

Each `result.value` serialises the isolation outcome. On success it is
a JSON array with one object per certification result, canonically sorted by
its object encoding so semantically irrelevant component traversal order does
not churn the committed fixture. Each object carries
`kind` (`"atom"` | `"cluster"`), `k` (root count, `1` for atoms), the
disc centre as an exact rational (`re_num` / `re_den` / `im_num` /
`im_den`, from `DyadicSquare.re`/`im` via `Dyadic.toRat`), and `prec`
(the stored square's precision). A `none` outcome from the driver
serialises as the JSON string `"none"` and is reported to stderr with its case
id.

The local JSON builders below (`certValue`, `noneValue`) exist because
the shared `Hex.Conformance.Emit` helpers only cover flat records; the
per-result object here is nested, so the driver hand-builds the array
payload and passes it to `emitResult` as a raw JSON fragment.
